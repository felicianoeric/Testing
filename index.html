    Long text can refer to a number of things, including a data type, a text in a database, or a text message:
Data type
A long text field is a data type that can store large amounts of information, such as comments, notes, and descriptions. For example, in Microsoft Access web apps, a long text field can store up to 2^30-1 bytes. In Microsoft, long text fields can support rich text formatting, such as different fonts, colors, and highlighting. 
Text in a database
In SAP, long texts are texts that are made up of multiple lines and are located in a text pool in the database. 
Text message
A long text message can be sent using a service like Textedly, which allows users to send texts with over 300 characters. Users can also add a picture to send an MMS message with up to 1,600 characters.  </p>
